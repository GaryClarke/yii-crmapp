# Documentation

Here we'll see some *Markdown* code.
It's easier to write text documents with simple formatting this way.

Imagine the user documentation here, describing:

1. [How to add Customers](/customers/add)
2. [How to find Customer by phone number](/customers/query)
3. [How to manage services](/services)
